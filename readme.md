Project Goals
---------

Make a unique observation about bitcoin with statistical significance or statistical **in**significance.

My first idea is to try to find some correlation in the log returns from bitcoin to that of gold in the 1970s.


First thing is first though,

we should build some robust returns analysis tools and investigate our crypto datasets.
