<h1>Crypto Currency as an Effective Hedge Agasint Currency Risk</h1>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>


Make a unique observation about cryptocurrencies with statistical significance or statistical **in**significance.


<h2>Possible Methods</h2>

* If we can correlate Crypto to Gold's performance historically, then we just need to prove gold's value
* Differentiate the different numerical metrics which identify a store of value or a currency hedge and evaluate crypto against these ideas


<h2>Steps</h2>

1. Define what we need to find in order to prove certain crypto as an effective store of value/currency hedge



<h2>To Prove</h2>

* What Proves a Store of Value?
        * A store of value is an asset that **maintains its value without depreciating**. **Gold** and other metals are good stores of value as their *shelf lives are essentially perpetual*, whereas a perishable item (milk, for example[or even currency]) is a poor store of value because of its propensity to decay. Interest-bearing assets, such as **U.S. Treasury bonds (T-bonds)**, are very good stores of value because they generate interest income and their **principal balances are backed by legal contracts.** ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/storeofvalue.asp))
    * Gold?
        * cons
            * constant supply growth
        * pros
    * U.S. Treasury Bills
        * Generate Passive Income
        * Backed by legal contracts and the faith of the US Government (trustworthy)
    
* What proves a Currency Hedge?
    * A forex hedge is a transaction implemented to **protect an existing or anticipated position from an unwanted move in exchange rates**. Forex hedges are used by a broad range of market participants, including investors, traders and businesses. By using a forex hedge properly, an individual who is long a foreign currency pair or expecting to be in the future via a transaction can be protected from downside risk. Alternatively, a trader or investor who is short a foreign currency pair can protect against upside risk using a forex hedge.

    * Protecting against an existing or anticipated position from an unwanted more in exchange rates

<h2>Current Ideas</h2>

* we should build some robust returns analysis tools and investigate our crypto datasets.

* My first idea is to try to find some correlation in the log returns from bitcoin to that of gold in the 1970s.
